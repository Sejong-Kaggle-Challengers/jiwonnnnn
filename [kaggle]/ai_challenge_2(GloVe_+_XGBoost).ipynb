            "I just purchased the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 from a local Verizon store. I am very disappointed with this phone. I paid full price to keep my unlimited data alive. I am finding that the RF reception is abysmal. In buildings where I used to get -89 dbm with my Motorola Droid Bionic, I get -118 dbm with the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Even outdoors, with the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, I don't get that great of a 4G LTE signal. The phone will usually then switch to 1 to 2 bars of 3G and stay there until I am back in a really strong 4G area. I'm thinking either the antenna is of poor quality or the radio is not very sensitive - or both. I may have to return this phone and try the LG G2. This GN3 cannot even begin to compete with my old Motorola Droid Bionic when it comes to holding on to a less than perfect signal.  In strong signal areas there is no problem, but when the signal isn't the best, the GN3 does a poor job of holding the 4G LTE signal.  My Motorola Droid Bionic used to do an outstanding job in the same exact places this GN3 fails.  The screen is brilliant, and you couldn't ask for a more feature packed phone.  The sound quality is good and volume level is great, but above all the GN3 has to be able to connect to a signal to be a great phone.  In the near future, Verizon is going to Voice over LTE (VoLTE).  This means that our phone conversations will now be carried on the 4G LTE band.  That really scares me with my GN3, since it can't maintain a 4G LTE signal unless I'm really in a strong signal area.\n",

It does not always sync with Google calendar, bee restored to factory, replaced completely 2 times including a new battery and still does not work properly. Motorola and Verizon both refused to replace the phone with a equal phone other than the same one even thought the phone is insured. Go to Best Buy, they honor their warranty with a phone that works equal to what you bought at time of purchase if you have problems.\n",
